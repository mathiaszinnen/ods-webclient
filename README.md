# ods-webclient

## Development Setup

We recomend to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development.

To ensure a consisten style you should use the following Visual Studio Code extension:

- Vetur: `ext install octref.vetur`

To enable auto formating on save go to `File > Preference > Settings` and add the option `"editor.formatOnSave": true`.

# Open Data Service Webclient

The Open Data Service (ODS) Webclient provide a webbased ui for easy configuration of the ODS. The ODS itself is a Java server application which can collect data from multiple sources simulataneously, process that data and then offer an improved (or "cleaned") version to its clients.

## Getting started
Make sure to have Angular Cli globally installed 'npm install -g @angular/cli'.  
'npm install' to resolve dependencies.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
